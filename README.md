# Jekyll theme for the Patterns of Life website

This repository contains the theme files for the
[Patterns of Life](https://www.patternsoflife.nl/en/) website.
It is based on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

Note that the entire website is generated out of three repositories:

- [patternsoflife/patternsoflife.github.io](https://github.com/patternsoflife/patternsoflife.github.io): dutch pages and large shared assets
- [patternsoflife/en](https://github.com/patternsoflife/en): english pages
- [patternsoflife/pages-theme](https://github.com/patternsoflife/pages-theme) (this repository): theme files and small shared assets

In addition to theming, this repository also contains small assets that are used by both language versions (logos etc).
Larger assets (like the video on the homepage) are kept in the Dutch version only and are referenced with absolutele links in page code.
